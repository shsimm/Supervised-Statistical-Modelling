# Limma-Voom Differential Expression Analyses built on top of Dream 

This repository contains code to run a limma-voom differential expression analysis. There are *two* files in this repository:
1. limma-voom differential expression (an analysis that will provide residuals and cohort specific differential expression)
2. mega-analysis (ana analysis that will provide cohort combined differential expression results)
